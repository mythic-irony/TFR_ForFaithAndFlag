		desc = "Born into a very average American family somewhere between 1986 and 1998, Ulysses completed school and enrolled in the military as soon as he graduated from high school, although he graduated on top of his class, his military career didnâ€™t last long after a few years of in the military he was dishonorably discharged. Without a purpose, he pivoted to the far right, with his nationalism and vast love for his nation, he joined the Patriot Front a a few months following its foundation after the Charlottesville Riots of 2017, he grew to be one of Rosseau's top commanders, organizing his rallies through a unknown Discord account, following the 2020 election, he was asked by Rosseau himself to help command Patriot Front militias in the inevitable upcoming conflict, which he agreed. He fought valiantly alongside his fellow soldiers for their cause, but even though they fought hell and back, the APLA still crushed every other faction and De La Riva stomped all over their faces. Ulysses had rage the likes most people have not seen before, bowing to do everything to bring the PSL and all its supporters down, whatever that may take, he also decided to fully reject and condemn any aspects of racial politics that he had to see during his tenure in the Patriot Front, deciding that America should be for every American. Following Gloria De La Riva's assassination, many anti-communist sleeper cells readied and awoken to fight back, deciding that this young man should lead them to victory, wearing a patriotic attire that represents him as a full blooded American, now Ulysses leads a coalition of all types of anti-communist forces, ready to strike at the Red Menance and end it once and for all.."
