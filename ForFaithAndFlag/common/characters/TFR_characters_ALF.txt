				desc="Nobody knows much about Ulysses, when has born, his family, nothing, all known is that Ulysses tried to enroll in the military while being underaged, he was caught and couldnt serve. Without a purpose, he pivoted to right wing politics, with his nationalism and vast love for his nation, he joined the Patriot Front in early 2020, where he quickly, grew to be one of Rosseau's top commanders, organizing his rallies through a unknown Discord account, following the 2020 election, he was asked by Rosseau himself to help command Patriot Front militias in the inevitable upcoming conflict, which he agreed. He fought valiantly alongside his fellow soldiers for their cause, but even though they fought hell and back, the APLA still crushed every other faction and De La Riva stomped all over their faces. Ulysses had rage the likes most people have not seen before, bowing to do everything to bring the PSL and all its supporters down, whatever that may take, he gave up and denounced the racialist ways of the PF and other radical factions in favor of a more inclusive American Resistance, following Gloria De La Riva's assassination, many anti-communist sleeper cells readied and awoken to fight back, deciding that this young man should lead them to victory, wearing a patriotic attire that represents him as a full blooded American, now Ulysses leads a coalition of all types of anti-communist forces, ready to strike at the Red Menance and end it once and for all."
